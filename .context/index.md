# Codebase Context CLI

A command-line interface tool for managing and validating codebase context specifications. This tool helps developers implement the Codebase Context Specification (CCS) effectively by providing utilities for creation, validation, and maintenance of `.context` directories.

## Key Features

- Create new `.context` directories with proper structure
- Validate existing `.context` directories against the CCS spec
- Generate `.contextignore` files with sensible defaults
- Lint context files for compliance and best practices

## Project Goals

1. Replace and enhance the functionality of the existing `codebase-context-lint` package
2. Provide a more user-friendly CLI interface for managing context files
3. Help standardize the implementation of the CCS across projects
4. Facilitate better documentation practices in development teams

## Architecture

The tool is built as a Node.js CLI application using TypeScript and Commander.js. It follows a modular architecture with distinct components for different functionalities:

- **Context Validator**: Ensures `.context` directories comply with the CCS
- **Context Generator**: Creates new context files and directories
- **Context Linter**: Checks for best practices and potential improvements

## Development Roadmap

1. Initial CLI setup with basic commands
2. Implementation of context validation
3. Context generation utilities
4. Advanced linting features
5. Integration with popular IDEs and tools
