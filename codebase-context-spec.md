# Codebase Context Specification

**Specification Version**: 1.1-RFC  
**Date**: 2024-11-19

## 1. Overview

The Codebase Context Specification (CCS) provides a structured framework for enriching software codebases with contextual information to empower both artificial intelligence (AI) tools and human developers. CCS is essential for software architects and developers to capture architectural insights, design decisions, and project-specific conventions clearly and comprehensively. This promotes deep visibility into the codebase, improves onboarding efficiency, and facilitates team collaboration. AI tools integrated with CCS can leverage explicit context to generate more insightful and context-aware suggestions, resulting in improved development efficiency, higher quality code, and a harmonized development environment. CCS helps streamline workflows, reduce ambiguities, and elevate both AI and human contributions.

Key benefits include:

1. **Enhanced AI Assistance**: Leveraging explicit, contextual metadata enables AI coding tools to deliver more accurate and relevant suggestions, reducing the need for extensive manual corrections and improving the efficiency of the coding process.
2. **Sophisticated Documentation**: Rich Markdown content, inclusive of diagrams, annotations, and multimedia, contributes to an engaging, informative documentation experience. This ensures that even complex architectural concepts are conveyed clearly and consistently across the team.
3. **Streamlined Collaboration**: Contextual information is co-located with the relevant code segments, enhancing team communication and minimizing ambiguities. This alignment ensures that developers, architects, and other stakeholders have a unified understanding of the codebase, thereby reducing misinterpretations.
4. **Scalability and Modularity**: A structured, hierarchical approach allows for seamless scaling in documentation, accommodating complex and large-scale projects effectively. This modularity also makes it easier to isolate, update, and maintain specific parts of the documentation without affecting the whole.

## 2. Key Principles

1. **Markdown-Centricity**: Utilize Markdown files for all context documentation, harnessing their rich formatting and extensive linking capabilities.
2. **Hierarchical Organization and Proximity**: Contextual information should be hierarchically organized within a `.context` directory at the project root, maintaining proximity to relevant code.
3. **Extensibility**: Enable extensibility through the support of modules and submodules, allowing interlinking with other repositories or directories containing their own `.context` structures.
4. **Rich Media Support**: Encourage the inclusion of diagrams, images, and advanced Markdown elements such as Mermaid and ZenUML to foster a more nuanced understanding.
5. **AI Interaction Governance**: Implement mechanisms that define and control how AI tools interact with the `.context` files, ensuring clear rules and permissions are in place for AI modifications.
6. **Wiki-Style Linking**: Adopt Obsidian-style linking conventions for seamless navigation between context documents, thus enhancing the developer experience.
7. **Tool-Agnostic Design**: The CCS is intentionally designed to be agnostic of any specific tools or platforms, making it adaptable to a wide range of development environments, individual tools, and multi-agent systems.
8. **Support for Individual and Multi-Agent Systems**: CCS can be employed effectively in projects worked on by individual developers as well as those involving multiple agents or collaborative teams, ensuring flexibility and scalability in documentation approaches.

## 3. File Structure

### 3.1 The `.context` Directory

All context-related documentation is organized within a dedicated `.context` directory located at the project root. This directory serves as the central repository for all project-wide context and may contain nested subdirectories for more granular modules and submodules. Such centralization ensures that relevant information remains readily discoverable, significantly reducing the effort expended by developers in seeking documentation and thereby improving consistency and comprehension across the project.

Each file or directory has a designated purpose:

- **index.md**: Serves as the entry point for project context, providing an overview and essential links to additional context files.
- **docs.md**: Contains supplementary documentation, such as project guidelines or detailed explanations of architectural decisions.
- **auth-service/**: Represents a specific module, such as an authentication service, containing its own `.context` directory for relevant contextual information.
  - **.context/index.md**: Provides an overview of the module, its architecture, and relationships to other modules.
  - **diagrams/**: Contains visual resources, such as sequence diagrams, to elucidate workflows and processes.
- **data-service/**: Represents another independent module, which also has its own `.context` directory and related resources.
  - **.context/images/**: Stores graphical elements, including flowcharts pertinent to the data service.

For a detailed example of the file structure, refer to the sample repository available [here](https://github.com/example/sample-context-structure).

### 3.2 `index.md` File

The `index.md` file within the `.context` directory functions as the primary entry point for contextual information, analogous to `index.html` in web development. It comprises structured metadata embedded in YAML front matter, supplemented by rich Markdown content, linking to relevant resources and documentation.

### 3.3 Modules and Submodules

The `.context` directory is organized hierarchically, with modules and submodules managed independently within their respective root-level directories. Each module maintains its own `.context` directory with an `index.md` file, accompanied by additional context-specific documents, diagrams, and visual aids.

For local references, when `index.md` references a module (e.g., `auth-service`), the system should look for the corresponding subdirectory (`auth-service`) within the current repository, which itself contains a `.context` directory for further contextual details. This allows each module to be independently documented, ensuring clear structure and discoverability within the local codebase.

For remote references, a virtual link should point to the relevant `.context` directory in an external repository, effectively allowing the system to integrate documentation and context from external projects seamlessly. This distinction between local and remote handling ensures that context is both scalable and modular, providing a unified approach to managing complexity across distributed codebases.

## 4. Content Guidelines

### 4.1 YAML Front Matter

Each `index.md` file commences with a YAML front matter section that captures structured metadata regarding the module. This metadata facilitates parsing by both human developers and automated tools, incorporating elements such as module name, version, description, technologies employed, conventions, and AI tool permissions. The most critical fields include:

- **module-name**: Specifies the formal name of the module.
- **version**: Denotes the module's current version, aiding in version control.
- **description**: Summarizes the overarching purpose and scope of the module.
- **technologies**: Enumerates the technologies utilized, providing insight into dependencies.
- **permissions**: Governs the AI tools' abilities, such as whether modifications to context are permissible.

**Example:**

```yaml
---
module-name: Awesome Project
version: 2.0.0
description: An awesome project that does amazing things.
related-modules:
  - name: Authentication Service
    path: auth-service/

---
```

### 4.2 Main Content

Following the YAML front matter, the body of the `index.md` should provide in-depth explanations, diagrams, embedded media, and links to additional context files or relevant external resources.

Instead of an inline example, refer to the detailed sample files in the [sample repository](https://github.com/example/sample-context-structure) to understand the expected structure and content.

### 4.3 Diagrams and Images

The CCS strongly advocates for the use of diagrams and images to augment textual explanations. Recommended tools and formats include:

- **Mermaid**: Ideal for generating sequence diagrams, flowcharts, and class diagrams.
- **ZenUML**: Suited for creating advanced UML diagrams.
- **Images**: Use formats such as PNG, SVG, or JPG for architectural visuals and UI mockups.

### 4.4 Obsidian-Style Linking

To enable seamless navigation, use wiki-style links:

- **Internal Link**: `[[auth-service/.context/index.md|Authentication Service]]`
- **External Link**: `[External Resource](https://external.resource.com)`

## 5. AI Tool Interaction

### 5.1 Permissions Control

Control AI tools' ability to modify `.context` files by utilizing the `allow-ai-modifications` flag within the YAML front matter.

- Set to `false` to prevent any AI-driven edits to context files.
- Set to `true` (default) to permit AI-assisted enhancements.

### 5.2 Recommendations for AI Tools

AI coding assistants are expected to adhere to the following:

1. **Detection**: Identify the presence of a `.context` directory at the project root to confirm the use of CCS.
2. **Context Incorporation**: Parse `index.md` to integrate its content into the AI's response logic for more context-aware suggestions.
3. **Respect Permissions**: Honor the `allow-ai-modifications` setting to align with the project's governance model.
4. **User Configurations**: Allow users the option to enable or disable CCS support, for instance, via a setting labeled "Use .context specification when detected".

**Use Case Example**: If `allow-ai-modifications` is set to `false`, the AI tool should still leverage contextual information for improved suggestions but refrain from making direct alterations to `.context` files. This maintains the integrity of critical documentation.

## 6. The `.contextignore` File

The `.contextignore` file, situated at the project root, dictates which files and directories should be excluded from context processing.

### Syntax

- Utilizes glob patterns, akin to `.gitignore`.
- Lines prefixed with `#` are treated as comments.

**Example:**

```
# Ignore logs
*.log

# Ignore temporary files
tmp/

# Ignore all files in 'node_modules' directories
**/node_modules/**

# Ignore specific file
src/experimental_feature.py
```

## 7. Additional Context Files

### 7.1 `docs.md`

Within the `.context` directory, `docs.md` serves as a central repository for extended documentation, guidelines, or technical articles relevant to the project.

**Example Reference:**

For more information, see the `docs.md` file in the [sample repository](https://github.com/example/sample-context-structure).

### 7.2 Obsidian-Style Linking and Additional Files

Additional Markdown files within the `.context` directory can be linked using Obsidian-style syntax.

**Example:**

- Create `design_patterns.md` with a detailed explanation of the design patterns.
- Reference it in `docs.md` using `[[design_patterns.md|Design Patterns]]`.

## 8. Modules and Submodules Hierarchy

### 8.1 Organization

Modules and submodules are organized in independent directories at the project root, each containing its own `.context` directory. This allows for distinct separation of concerns and clear ownership of documentation within each module. This structure supports a mono-repo approach where different services or components within a project can maintain modular, independent contexts.

### 8.2 Linking Between Modules

Relative paths or Obsidian-style links should be employed to establish connections between different modules.

**Example in `index.md`:**

## Modules

- [[auth-service/.context/index.md|Module 1: Authentication Service]]
- [[data-service/.context/index.md|Module 2: Data Processing Service]]

## 9. Tool Support Guidance

### 9.1 Getting Started for Tool Developers

To integrate CCS into coding tools, follow these steps:

1. **Detect `.context` Directory**: Identify the presence of a `.context` folder at the project's root.
2. **Parse `index.md`**: Extract the YAML front matter and main content from `index.md` for context incorporation.
3. **Incorporate Context**: Utilize the parsed content in processing logic or system prompts for AI-assisted development.
4. **Respect Permissions**: Abide by the `allow-ai-modifications` flag for any AI-driven edits to context files.
5. **Provide User Control**: Ensure there are settings available for users to activate or deactivate CCS features.

### 9.2 Advanced Integration (Optional)

- **Module Navigation**: Enable AI tools to navigate and utilize context across modules and submodules.
- **Diagram Rendering**: Implement rendering capabilities for Mermaid and ZenUML diagrams within the tool interface.
- **Wiki-Style Linking**: Facilitate seamless navigation through the use of wiki-style links.
- **Dynamic Context Expansion**: Fetch and incorporate additional context dynamically when referenced during code analysis or documentation.

### 9.3 Best Practices

- **Performance Optimization**: Cache context data to reduce processing delays and improve responsiveness.
- **User Experience**: Clearly indicate when context data is being employed, ensuring transparency.
- **Security Considerations**: Safeguard the retrieval of external resources, ensuring all integrations are secure.

## 10. Deprecations and Removals

Version 1.1 introduces the following deprecations:

- **Removed**: Direct support for `.context.json` and `.context.yaml` files. All context information is now Markdown-based, utilizing its rich formatting and interlinking capabilities.
- **Deprecated**: The single `.context.md` file at the project root has been replaced by the `.context` directory with an `index.md`. This reorganization enhances scalability and modularity, facilitating more effective navigation and management of complex projects.

## 11. Conclusion

The Codebase Context Specification version 1.1 represents a significant enhancement in both project documentation and AI tool integration by:

- Centralizing contextual documentation in a `.context` directory.
- Leveraging the inherent capabilities of Markdown for enriched documentation, including diagrams and images.
- Supporting hierarchical documentation structures to manage complexity.
- Providing explicit control over AI interactions with project context.
- Promoting the use of wiki-style links to improve navigability.
